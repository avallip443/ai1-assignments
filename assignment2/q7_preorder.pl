%%%%% TEST TREES
% Below you can find two test trees. 
% They have been added using atomic statements of the form testTree(TestNum, Tree).
% You can use them in a query as follows:
%
% ?- testTree(1, T), preorder(T, List).
%
% That will match T to the first test tree, and then run your preorder program on it.
% 
% You may also add additional tree below for testing in this way, though we will not mark them.

% Test Tree 1
% This tree has a root named a, which has 3 leaf children named 1, 2, 3
% The expected answer for preorder on this tree is next(a, next(1, next(2, next(3, nil))))
testTree(1,
    tree3(a,
            tree3(1, none, none, none),
            tree3(2, none, none, none),
            tree3(3, none, none, none)
        )
).

% This is the tree from the assignment description.
% See the expected answer for preorder there
testTree(2, 
    tree3(a,  % The root node has name a
            tree3(b, % Left child of a is b
                    tree3(e, none, none, none),   % Left child of b is e. It is a leaf node
                    tree3(f, none, none, none),   % Middle child of b is f. It is a leaf node
                    none  % There is no right child of b
                    ),
            tree3(c, none, none, none),  % Middle child of a is c. It is a leaf node
            tree3(d,   % Right child of a is d
                    tree3(g, 
                        none,
