%%%%% SECTION: fertilizersDescription
%%%%% Put a brief description of your program below

When I run the program from solve_and_print, I first initalize all attributes for each plant with some distinct value. Each attribute is assigned values in their assign_attribute predicate. Within each of these predciates, I assign distinct values using the all_diff predicate. I also included conditions that are exlcusive to that specific attribute i.e. conditions that are connected to only the plant number and not any other attribute, such has plant 5's weight not being the heaviest. After assigning the values, I then include the conditions that are depend on 2 or more attributes, such as a specific fertilizer having a certain weight. For these conditions, I used maxList or minList to get the largest or smallest value for each attribute and specific condition.
